<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may modify Max's code to run with environment variables to keep the API key hidden.

### Prerequisites

We use the dotenv library in Python and the Polygon-api-client library
* Pip
  ```sh
  pip install python-dotenv
  ```
  Make sure to install this version: pip install polygon-api-client==0.2.11
  * Pip
  ```sh
  pip install python-dotenv
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Add your API key to the .env file as api-token = "\<insert key>". The code will automatically recognize this API key and use it to form a connection with Polygon.
